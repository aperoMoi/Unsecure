## Report an Error or Bug

* Include *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the bug or error on their own.

Once it's filed:

* The project team will [label the issue].
* A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no repro steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as `needs-repro`. Bugs with the `needs-repro` tag will not be addressed until they are reproduced.
* If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked `needs-fix`, as well as possibly other tags (such as `critical`), and the issue will be left to be [implemented by someone].

* `critical` issues may be left open, depending on perceived immediacy and severity, even past the 30 day deadline.
